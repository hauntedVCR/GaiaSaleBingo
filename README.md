# Gaia Sale Bingo
This was a project that was sparked by a gaia user's comment about making a bingo game for the seasonal sales that happen on GaiaOnline. This is just for fun. This a fan-project and not officially endorsed by GaiaOnline. The project itself will get updated from time to time as each sale occurs, so check back again later for different things.
